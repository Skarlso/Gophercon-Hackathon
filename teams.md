Project:

Blockchain listener and indexer according to different data protocols. The project built involves a new data feed from the blockchain which will publish new transactions containing specific data on different channels/topics that users can subscribe to. This can be used to create decentralised applications where the data is not stored and controlled by one entity (such as Twitter or Facebook). In contrast, anyone can post data (according to a specific protocol) onto the blockchain and then any front end app service can just subscribe to this data feed and display the data to its users.  

More details can be found on our project repo created for the hackathon [here](https://github.com/nch-bowstave/nchain-ably).
