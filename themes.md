# THEMES: 
Each of the four hackathon themes listed below is eligible as a prize category for a Â£100 Amazon gift card per member of team with top winning project, maximum 4 people per team. There is also one top submission winner where each team member will receive Apple Airpods Pro for the project that best encompasses the theme and general awesomeness.

**Open data**:

We host free data streams for any data feeds that are open and interesting to share. Why not make another data source available this way and show us what you could build with it?

**Hacktober**:

Ably SDKs are open source and often embedded in other tools and frameworks. We need to make sure that they're reliable and robust. Can you find any bugs? Can you raise a PR for fixes and improvements to any of our libraries? Could you add Ably support to other libraries?

**API specifications**:

Asynchronous APIs are here to stay and constantly evolving. Documenting them is hard. Can you help us improve our existing docs, and aid in the discoverability of AsyncAPIs and the data they carry?

**Distributed computing**:

With a fault-tolerant messaging layer and hard guarantees, surely distributed computing is easy? How many machines can you coordinate in this way? How many users can you support? Can you build something that uses distributed computing to encourage collaboration between hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of users simultaneously?

## Notes

Don't feel confined by these categories. They're just there to get you thinking ... and to help us score your submission. We just want to see where your imagination leads you, and we're excited to see what you build with our tech.

We'll help by giving you a funded Ably account for the week of the hack to allow you to build and test. If you submit an entry, we'll extend it for the month. Plus we'll be on hand to bounce ideas around and help if you get stuck.

We can't wait to see what you come up with!
